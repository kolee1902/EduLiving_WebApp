This web application is built using **Streamlit** and leverages two key datasets:
- **High School Data** in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC)
- **Real Estate Data** in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC)

The application serves two primary purposes:
1. **Data Analysis** - Analyzing and comparing the high school and real estate data to derive insights.
2. **Recommendation Chatbot** - Providing users with real estate recommendations near the high school of their choice based on their budget.

## Features

### 1. **Data Analysis Tab**
   - **Overview**: This tab allows users to explore and analyze two datasets:
     - High School Data: Information on various high schools in HCMC, such as location, reputation, and school type.
     - Real Estate Data: Listings of properties for sale or rent around HCMC, including location, price range, and property type.
   - **Capabilities**:
     - Visualize trends, comparisons, and relationships between the high school locations and nearby real estate listings.
     - Analyze the distribution of real estate prices and the proximity to high schools.
     - Generate insights about the best real estate areas based on school ratings and affordability.

### 2. **Recommendation Chatbot Tab**
   - **Overview**: The chatbot helps users find real estate options based on two inputs:
     - **High School**: The user can select their preferred high school from the list.
     - **Budget Range**: Users specify their budget range for buying or renting property.
   - **Capabilities**:
     - The chatbot will process the userâ€™s input and provide a list of real estate recommendations that meet their criteria.
     - Recommendations are tailored to offer properties that are close to the selected high school and fall within the specified budget range.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive user interface.
- **Pandas**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing the data.
- **Python**: For scripting the back-end logic.
